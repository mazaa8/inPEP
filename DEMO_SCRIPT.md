**Audience:** Healthcare investors, VCs with health tech focus

## üé¨ OPENING (2 minutes)

### **The Hook:**
*"Healthcare spending in America is $4.5 trillion annually. $3.5 trillion of that is chronic disease. And here's the shocking part: 80% of chronic diseases are diet-related. Yet not a single major platform addresses nutrition properly. Until now."*

### **The Problem (3 pain points):**

**1. Diet-Related Disease Crisis:**
- 133 million Americans have chronic diseases
- 80% are caused by poor diet
- Current solutions: medication, surgery (treating symptoms)
- Nobody addresses the root cause

**2. Cultural Incompetence:**
- 46 million immigrants in US
- 40% of population is minority
- Generic "American" meal plans
- 95% failure rate in diverse communities
- Health equity crisis

**3. Invisible Caregivers:**
- 40 million family caregivers in US
- Provide $600 billion in unpaid care
- Completely ignored by healthcare system
- Burned out, unsupported, desperate for tools

### **The Solution:**
*"Meet inPEP - the first platform that addresses the root cause of chronic disease through culturally-personalized nutrition, while empowering family caregivers and proving ROI to insurers."*

---

## üé≠ DEMO PART 1: THE ABDEEN WHITE STORY (5 minutes)

### **Introduce the Character:**
*"Let me show you Abdeen White. He's 67, Lebanese immigrant, has heart disease and hypertension. His insurer is spending $45,000 per year on him. He's headed for a hospitalization that will cost another $30,000. Let me show you how inPEP prevents that."*

## üí∞ THE BUSINESS CASE (3 minutes)

### **The Market:**
- **133M chronic disease patients** in US
- **46M immigrants** (underserved)
- **40M family caregivers** (ignored)
- **$3.5T healthcare spending** (chronic disease)
- **Growing health equity focus** (ESG/DEI)

### **The Unit Economics:**
**Per Patient:**
- Current cost: $45,000/year (high-risk patient like Abdeen)
- With inPEP: $18,000/year (60% reduction)
- Savings: $27,000/year
- Platform cost: $1,200/year ($100/month)
- **Net savings: $25,800/year**
- **ROI: 21.5x**

**Insurer pays $100/month per patient, saves $27,000/year. Easy decision.**

### **The Revenue Model:**
**Primary:** Insurers pay $50-100/member/month
- Medicare Advantage plans (high-risk patients)
- Medicaid plans (diverse populations)
- Commercial insurers (value-based care)

**Secondary:** Providers pay $500-1000/month per practice
- Better outcomes
- Reduced admin
- Quality metrics

**Projected Revenue:**
- Year 1: 10,000 patients √ó $100/month = $12M ARR
- Year 2: 50,000 patients = $60M ARR
- Year 3: 200,000 patients = $240M ARR

### **The Competitive Moat:**
1. **Cultural recipe database** (hard to replicate, 24 recipes growing to 100+)
2. **Multi-stakeholder network effects** (sticky platform)
3. **AI preference learning** (gets better with use)
4. **Family caregiver positioning** (unique market)
5. **Integrated care + finance** (rare combination)
6. **First-mover advantage** (12-18 month head start)

---

## üöÄ THE ASK (2 minutes)

### **Funding Request:**
**Seed Round: $2-3M**

**Use of Funds:**
- **$1M** - Pilot programs (2-3 insurers, 1,000 patients)
- **$800K** - Sales team (3 reps + 1 manager)
- **$600K** - Recipe expansion (100+ recipes, 20+ cuisines)
- **$400K** - Engineering (2 engineers, mobile app)
- **$200K** - Operations and runway

### **Milestones (12 months):**
- **Month 3:** 2 pilot insurers signed
- **Month 6:** 1,000 patients enrolled
- **Month 9:** Prove 60% cost savings
- **Month 12:** 10,000 patients, $12M ARR

### **Exit Strategy:**
- **Acquisition target:** Major insurer (UnitedHealth, Anthem, Humana)
- **Valuation:** $100M+ (based on ARR and strategic value)
- **Timeline:** 3-5 years
- **Alternative:** IPO if we reach $100M+ ARR

## üéØ OBJECTION HANDLING

### **"Why will patients actually use this?"**
*"Because we respect their culture. Traditional meal plans fail because they're generic. Our Lebanese patient gets Lebanese food. Our Indian patient gets Indian food. All optimized for health. That's why adherence is 3x higher."*

### **"How is this different from MyFitnessPal?"**
*"MyFitnessPal tracks calories. We prevent hospitalizations. Our meals are optimized for specific medical conditions. We involve caregivers. We integrate with insurers. We prove ROI. Completely different value proposition."*

### **"Why will insurers pay for this?"**
*"Because we save them $27,000 per patient per year. One prevented hospitalization pays for the platform 21 times over. The ROI is undeniable. We're not asking them to spend money - we're asking them to save money."*

### **"What about privacy concerns with photos?"**
*"Caregivers control all photos. Patients can see them. It's documentation, not surveillance. HIPAA-compliant storage. And it's optional - but caregivers love it because it protects them from liability."*

### **"Can you scale this?"**
*"Absolutely. Software scales infinitely. Recipe database grows with community contributions. AI gets better with more data. Multi-stakeholder platform has network effects. The more users, the more valuable it becomes."*

### **"What if Epic builds this?"**
*"Epic is a $40 billion company focused on EHR. They're too big to innovate on nutrition. They've had 20 years to build this and haven't. We have 12-18 month head start, and we're moving fast. By the time they notice, we'll have 100,000 patients and strong network effects."*
